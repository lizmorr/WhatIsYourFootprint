    %h4 What are emissions?
    %p 
      Carbon emission refers to the carbon dioxide that is released into the 
      atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. Fossil fuels with higher 
      carbon content will have higher emissions. Carbon emissions are a driver 
      of climate change.

    %h4 Why track?
    %p 
      Tracking your personal emissions (your carbon footprint) can give you insight 
      into how your actions may have an impact on the environment. There are two kinds 
      of emissions to track: direct and indirect.
    
    %p
      %em Direct emissions 
      are emissions created by sources you own or control. For an individual, 
      this would be your car or heating your house.
    
    %p
      %em Indirect emissions
      are emissions created by someone else on your behalf. Emissions that 
      would fall into this are the emissions created by electricity 
      generation or the production of goods made. For the purposes of tracking 
      here, we consider emissions related to the purchase of electricity.

      Once you are registered, you can enter your usage for the different sources
      of emissions you are responsible for. Information can come from your electric,
      gas, or oil bills. Information will also come from how much gas you use in your
      car.
    %p
      When you have new information, log in and click on new personal usage. That's
      where you enter your energy usage. Those emissions will be added to your personal
      total!
